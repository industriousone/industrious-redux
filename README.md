# Industrious.Redux

A predictable state container for .NET applications, inspired by [ReduxJS](https://redux.js.org).

Still in progress, though all the basics are working. See `Examples.Counter` and `Examples.SyncViews` for usage examples.

To do list:

- make it easier to work with collections
- finish up the examples
- proper docs
- async actions
- middleware

Industrious.Redux is delivered as a .NET Standard 2.0 assembly, so it should work pretty much anywhere you do.
