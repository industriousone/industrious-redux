# Industrious.Redux

A (really) simple, predictable state container for .NET applications, inspired by [ReduxJS](https://redux.js.org).

- Delivered as a .NET Standard 2.0 assembly, so it should work pretty much anywhere you do.
- Depends only on `System.Collections.Immutable`, which you'll probably want to use in your own state objects anyway.

To do list:

- [ ] Basic usage documentation
- [ ] Make it easier to work with collections
- [ ] Port the old examples off Xamarin.Forms ([Counter](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-redux/tree/main/Examples.Counter), [SyncViews](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-redux/tree/main/Examples.SyncViews))

Industrious.Redux is delivered as a .NET Standard 2.0 assembly, so it should work pretty much anywhere you do.
